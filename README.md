# Simulink_PumpedStorageHydropower
Simulink models of Fixed-Speed, Variable-Speed, and Ternary Pumped Storage Hydropower.

Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) is one of the most popular energy storage technologies in the world. It uses an upper reservoir to store water which can be later used during high-demand. In the US, most of the energy storage capability actually corresponds to PSH. Moreover, PSH also brings multiple benefits to grid operation.

The attached report presents the Simulink models of three common PSH technologies: Fixed Speed (FS), Variable Speed (VS), and Ternary (T)-PSH. Such models are available to the general public on this repository, which contains the MATLAB model initialization files, the Simulink model files, and supplementary MATLAB code used to obtain the figures in this work.

For each PSH model, an introductory description of the model components and other relevant functionalities are provided. For further information regarding the models and the initialization parameters, the author is referred to the shared files. This report also presents the dynamic behavior of each model. The response of such models to a load event is analyzed and matched with each modelâ€™s features. A custom IEEE 39 bus case is employed for the FS and T-PSH simulations, while the VS-PSH is simulated on a simplified three-bus test system due to the computational complexity of the model. For the T-PSH, the steady-state and the switching between several operating modes are also studied in this work.
